# Meetup_MineR
An algorithm to mine www.meetup.com to identify best activity groups to attend in a city.

# What is the problem?
[Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/) is fantastic way to meet new people and do fun activities. However, identifying the right meetup groups can be a challenge. Some groups are older and inactive whereas others just do not have enough people attending them.
